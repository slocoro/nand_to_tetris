How do labels work in Hack machine language??

Assume this code:

(my_label)
A=D
M=D
...

When the assembler sees "(my_label)" it memorizes the number (line number n means the n-th command in your program)
of the line right after it. In this case it memorises the line number( or operation number) of "A=D". This line number
is then used in combination with a jump operation (see below) to go (back) this line when the program needs it.

Don't confuse ROM (the memory that holds the program) and RAM (the memory that has the stack and your variables, object, ...)!!!

jump example:

@21
0;JEQ
