n arguments: the number of arguments a function takes
n locals: the number of local variables a function defines withing its scope

first thing you need to do when you see:
func Bar.mult 2
is the generate a label (Bar.mult)

when you see a call command you need to generate a return address e.g.:
call Bar.mult 2 -> (Foo$ret.1)


To do:
- extend to parse a directory notjust a file
- extend parser to parse, goot, if-goto, label, call, function, return

start implementing program flow in terms of commands
