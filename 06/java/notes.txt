To run the Java assembler use the following commands. Run the commands from "nand2tetris/projects/06/java/src".

Compile code:
javac com/java/assembler/*.java 

Run assembler:
java com.java.assembler/Assembler

This is necessary as I'm not using a build tool like, for example, maven or gradle.


To do:
- implement symbol table logic
